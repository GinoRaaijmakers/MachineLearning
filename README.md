# MachineLearning
Previous research indicated that screening of fragmentation patterns of cfDNA is a good method to distinguish premature cancer patients from healthy individuals. To be able to detect these differences Cristiano et al. developed a machine learning approach called the DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception (DELFI). DELFI can detect abnormalities of cfDNA fragmentation profiles at the genome-wide level with a specificity up to 95%. The DELFI algorithms will be reproduced with the data set used in the Cristiano et al. paper, to test the algorithm. After achieving this, DELFI could be used for other data sets (Snyder and Hao) of patients that still need a diagnosis.

This dataset is openly available in the NCBI short read archive (SRA) with project number PRJNA291063. The bloodplasma of multiple people with the same type of cancer, or healthy patients, is was pooled before it was sequenced. This made sure it does not have to abide by privacy limitations.
